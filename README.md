# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic 

* Stay within your lane unless Lane change is required
* Change lane when a slow moving vehicle is going ahead and the nearby lane is free
* No collisions should occur, during lane changing or lane keeping.

#### Constraints:
1. 50 MPH speed limit
2. Accleration (change in velocity less than +- 10 m/s) less than 10 m^2/s
3. Jerk (change in acceleration less than +-10 m^2/s) less than 10 m^3/s
4. Total distance travlled without any instance should be more than 4.32 Miles

#### Inputs:
* car's localization
* sensor fusion data
* sparse map list of waypoints around the highway.
